This project contains UI and API tests covering scenarios related to the change of price of BTC-USD using Google Finance.

The only prerequisite to using this repo is having npm installed and running 
npm ci
to get all the needed dependancies. 

Each type of test (UI or API) has a separate feature and can be run using their dedicated command (test-ui or test-api respectively).
